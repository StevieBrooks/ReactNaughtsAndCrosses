## What's Inside?

After building my first project in React, I quickly learned that prop drilling is a royal pain in the neck. Thankfully, I discovered useContext and this Noughts & Crosses project is how I've put that knowledge to work. 

### Motivation

It's simple. I tried building an educational Whack-a-Mole game for my second React project and quickly realised I'd bitten off more than I could chew. I took a step back by building this little beauty instead. 

### What did I learn?

It took me just under two weeks to complete this project so firstly, I learned that I'm faster and debugging than I originally thought. I also gained plenty of experience with the useContext hook and also learned the basics of useEffect. 

But that's not all. During this project, I was also able to experiment a lot with conditional styling and developed my understanding of TailwindCSS. 

### What's special about this project?

The most notable features of this Noughts & Crosses game are the ability to assign players and change the theme.

The aim of the game is to get 3 of your icons in a row. A secondary objective is to stop your opponent from doing the same. Good luck!
